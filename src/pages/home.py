        **Step 1: Choose a Task **
        - First define what is the task that we are trying to solve 
        
        **Step 2: Choose a model**
        - Models designed or trained for a specific task, therefore, we want to browse only models that are trained 
        for the selected task
        
        **Step 3: Choose Generation Params**
        - There are degrees of freedom in deciding how to create the resulted output by the logits...

        **Step 4: See and compare the results**
        - See multiple models output simultaneously and notice the difference in the results
